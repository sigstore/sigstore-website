Rekor aims to provide an immutable, tamper-resistant ledger of metadata generated within a software project’s supply chain.

It enables software maintainers and build systems to record signed metadata to an immutable record. Other parties can then query this metadata, enabling them to make informed decisions on trust and non-repudiation of an object’s lifecycle.

The Rekor project provides a restful API-based server for validation, and a transparency log for storage. A CLI application is available to make and verify entries, query the log for inclusion proof, integrity verification of the log or retrieval of entries (either by a public key or an artifact).

Rekor fulfils the signature transparency role of sigstore’s software signing infrastructure. It can also be run on its own, and it’s designed to be extensible to working with different manifest schemas and PKI tooling.

## Usage and installation

There are a few ways to deploy a Rekor Server:

1.  We have a [docker-compose](https://github.com/sigstore/rekor/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) file available
2.  A [kubernetes operator](https://github.com/sigstore/rekor-operator)
3.  Or you could do this manually and build rekor yourself.

### Prerequisites

You will need golang version 1.15 or greater and a `$GOPATH` set.

If you want to perform fast queries you will need to add redis, otherwise you must pass the `--enable_retrieve_api=false`
flag when running `rekor-server` in the later steps of this page.

### Get Rekor

Grab the rekor source:

`go get -u -t -v github.com/sigstore/rekor/cmd/rekor-server`

> Note: You can also `git clone https://github.com/sigstore/rekor.git` should you prefer.

### Create Database and populate tables

Trillian requires a database. We use MariaDB for now (others to be explored later). Once this
is installed on your machine, edit the `scripts/createdb.sh` file with your database root account credentials and run the
script. If you're just trying out rekor, keep the DB user name and password the same as in the script (test/zaphod). If
you change these, you need to make the changes on Trillian's side (visit the trillian repo for details).

### Build Trillian

To run rekor you need to build trillian:

```
go get -u -t -v github.com/google/trillian
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/google/trillian/cmd/trillian_log_server
go build
cp trillian_log_server /usr/local/bin/
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/google/trillian/cmd/trillian_log_signer
go build
cp trillian_log_signer /usr/local/bin/
```

#### Start the tlog server

```
trillian_log_server -http_endpoint=localhost:8090 -rpc_endpoint=localhost:8091 --logtostderr ...
```

#### Start the tlog signer

```
trillian_log_signer --logtostderr --force_master --http_endpoint=localhost:8190 -rpc_endpoint=localhost:8191  --batch_size=1000 --sequencer_guard_window=0 --sequencer_interval=200ms
```

#### Build Rekor Server

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/sigstore/rekor/cmd/server
go build -v -o rekor-server
cp rekor-server /usr/local/bin/
```

#### Start the rekor server

```
