    header: The problem with open source security
    imageAsset: /img/problemwithopensource_update.svg
    text:
      Open source software, although a powerful developement tool, can leave your project open to breaches, exploits, and supply chain attacks. The risks can be difficult to spot, and safely using open source dependencies can require constant identity checks and careful safety protocols for keys and secrets.

    cardTitle: What makes Sigstore different?
    text:
      Sigstore's goal is to improve supply chain technology for anyone using
      open source projects. It's made for open source maintainers, by open source
      maintainers.
    header: Our vision
    bgColour: bg-pastel-blue
    imageAsset: ''
    textBottom:
      Sigstore is a direct response to today’s supply chain challenges. We are working towards a future where there is a broadly accepted (and achievable) project integrity standard.
    type: twoColumnBannerWithCard
    column1:
      header: Automatic key management
      imageAsset: /img/keys.svg
      text: We use Cosign to generate the key pairs needed to sign and verify
        artifacts, automating as much as possible so there’s no risk of losing
        or leaking them.
    column2:
      header: Transparent ledger technology
      imageAsset: /img/ledger.svg
      text:
        A transparency log means anyone can find and verify signatures, and check
        whether someone’s changed the source code, the build platform or the
        artifact repository.
    cardText: We’ve automated how you digitally sign and check components, for a
      safer chain of custody tracing software back to the source. We want to
      remove the effort, time and risk of error this usually comes with. And for
      anyone whose software depends on open source, future integrations can make
      it easier to check for authenticity, wherever it’s come from.
    column3:
      header: Driven by our community
      imageAsset: /img/community.svg
      text: Everyone involved in Sigstore believes in an open, transparent and
        accountable future for open source software. Everything we do comes from
        that shared vision.
