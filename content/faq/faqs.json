    {
      "question": "What can I sign and store?",
      "answer": "Sigstore tooling supports signing any artifacts, such as files or containers. Rekor supports many file formats, such as in-toto attestations, JARs, RPMs, or Alpine images. Sigstore is also actively being integrated with package repositories to ease the adoption of signing for their communities."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the current status?",
      "answer": "Sigstore announced general availability (GA) for the Rekor transparency log and Fulcio certificate authority public benefit services in October 2022. Cosign, one of the Sigstore clients, had its v2.0 release in February 2023, and other Sigstore clients, including sigstore-js and sigstore-python, have had v1.0 releases. Sigstore is actively developing client tooling for other package repositories and upstream communities."
    },
    {
      "question": "How easy is it to use?",
      "answer": "As easy as we can make it. Signing and verifying seems like a lot of extra effort with a lot of pitfalls. Our aim is to design away the manual effort and risk of error, automating the signing into a few simple commands. Verification and signing is greatly simplified by leveraging identity-based, or keyless, workflows."
