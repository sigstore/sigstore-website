  "textBlock": "Sigstore began as a collaboration between Red Hat and Google's Open Source Security Team to design technologies for signing and verifying code. The team created freely available, automated solutions for developers to sign their releases and to verify the provenance of all software.\n\nSigstore is now developed by Red Hat, Google, Purdue, and open source experts across the industry with the support and encouragement from the Linux Foundation. Sigstore's active community drives the project forward towards our goal of being the industry standard solution for signing and verifying software."
